51. N-Queens
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

# queeen can move all 4 directions and diagonally.
# pattern for negative diagonal. we are increasing row and col values by 1. r-c stays constant
# pattern for positive diagonal. r+c stays constant

# If you execute your script using Python you will not see any difference though. You need to run your scripts with Mypy, which is a static type checker that supports protocol classes.
