## Binary Tree
- each node has at most 2 children
- there is exactly 1 root.
- exactly 1 path from root to node
- empty tree is a binary tree
- tree has only 1 node is singleton tree and binary
## Traversal
- In the case of binary search trees (BST), Inorder traversal gives nodes in non-decreasing order
- Postorder traversal is used to delete the tree.
